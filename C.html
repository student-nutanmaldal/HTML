    <p>A paragraph is a group of sentences that develop a single idea. Paragraphs can be stand-alone or part of an essay, but each paragraph should focus on one main idea. 
        Here are some characteristics of a paragraph:
        Topic sentence: A paragraph should begin with a topic sentence that expresses the main idea. 
        Supporting sentences: The sentences that follow the topic sentence should support the main idea. 
        Flow: The sentences in a paragraph should maintain a consistent flow. 
        Organization: Paragraphs help readers understand the organization of an essay and grasp its main points. 
        Paragraphs can contain many different types of information, such as: 
        Examples, Illustrations, Descriptions, Narratives, Comparisons, Classifications, and Causes and effects.
        The word "paragraph" comes from the Greek word paragraphos, which means "line used to mark change of persons in a dialogue". The first known use of the word "paragraph" was in the 15th century. </p>
